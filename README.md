This project focuses on performing data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset from Kaggle to understand the structure, relationships, and patterns within the data. The dataset contains passenger information such as age, gender, ticket class, fare, and survival status. Data cleaning steps include handling missing values, correcting data types, and removing inconsistencies to ensure data quality. Exploratory data analysis is then conducted using statistical summaries and visualizations to examine relationships between variables and identify trends affecting survival, such as the impact of gender, passenger class, and age. Through charts and graphs, the project reveals key insights and patterns that help in understanding the factors influencing survival outcomes. Overall, this analysis demonstrates the importance of EDA in gaining meaningful insights before applying predictive models.
